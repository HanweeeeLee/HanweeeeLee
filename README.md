### Introduction 👋
Hello! I am an experienced developer specializing in iOS and macOS application development, as well as Dapp and blockchain wallet development. Currently, I am working on developing Dapps, blockchain wallets, and SDKs for iOS on the Wemix platform, a leading blockchain platform.  
  
My development approach emphasizes object-oriented programming and clean architecture. I strive to write code that is easy to modify and stable, ensuring it poses no problems. My focus extends beyond just app development; I consider service levels, development efficiency, and stability in all projects within the company.  
  
In addition to my professional work, I founded a programming theory study group a few years ago. We operate in a seminar format, with weekly presentations. More information about this can be found [here](https://github.com/WBBookStudy/Notice). 📚  
  
I am also engaged in various side projects for several reasons:
 - To apply new technologies and theories beyond my professional work. 🔧
 - To indulge my passion for development. 🔥
 - To collaborate with and learn from talented individuals from different companies. 🤝
The details of these projects can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Team-Archive). 📂  
  
Thank you for visiting my profile!🙇🏻‍♂️
