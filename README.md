### Introduction 👋
Hello! I’m a developer with hands-on experience in iOS apps, macOS apps, and SDK development.

Currently, I’m working as an iOS developer on the Customer Journey Team at Coupang,
where I build various features to improve the shopping experience for users of the Coupang app,
used by more than 33 million people each month.

Previously, I was the iOS lead developer at the innovative global blockchain platform WEMIX.
There, I successfully led the development of the Wemix Wallet app, which was used by up to 1.8 million monthly users,
and I also designed and maintained the iOS SDK integrated into the global MMORPG MIR4, which attracted around 6 million active users worldwide.
  
My development approach emphasizes object-oriented programming and clean architecture. I strive to write code that is easy to modify and stable, ensuring it poses no problems. My focus extends beyond just app development; I consider service levels, development efficiency, and stability in all projects within the company.  
  
In addition to my professional work, I founded a programming theory study group a few years ago. We operate in a seminar format, with weekly presentations. More information about this can be found [here](https://github.com/WBBookStudy/Notice). 📚  
  
I am also engaged in various side projects for several reasons:
 - To apply new technologies and theories beyond my professional work. 🔧
 - To indulge my passion for development. 🔥
 - To collaborate with and learn from talented individuals from different companies. 🤝

Thank you for visiting my profile! 😊
